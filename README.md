What you will need to run this program:<br>
- <em>Python</em>- To run this program, you must have some way to run a .py file. Also, this program was written using python 3.8.3, and has not been tested using any previous version.
- <em>.csv file</em>- In order to create your own flashcard sets, you will have to be able to create and format a .csv file of your own so that the program can use the flashcard set you've created. The folder holding the .py program has an example .csv file whose format can be easily followed and copied. It is easiest to simpy copy the .csv file given in the folder, and write your own questions and answers in.
